# Sceptred

_This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,_<br>
_This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,_<br>
_This other Eden, demi-paradise,_<br>
_This fortress built by Nature for her self_<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;â€” William Shakespeare, _Richard II_

_Sceptred_ is a project to model the British Isles in 3D, using open-source data.
